                        Im currently an Engineer at <strong>Upstatement</strong> building things for the web with some awesome people. I
                        recently graduated from <strong>Northeastern University</strong> after completing three awesome six-month co-ops at
                        <strong>MullenLowe U.S.</strong>, <strong>Starry</strong>, and <strong>Apple Music.</strong>

                        As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my
                        technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always
                        build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging,
                        pixel-perfect user experiences.
